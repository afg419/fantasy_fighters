# Fantasy Fighters!!!


A rails app which allows competitive martial arts dojos to register for the Fight of DEATH.  Once registered, the dojo can invite/register their combatants, specifying their martial skills in strength, intelligence and dexterity.  The Fight of DEATH is ruled over by a combat federation -- the winner of last year's tournament -- who can invite combatants from competing dojos to face one another!  Winners and losers both have their stats update as they gain experience (or injuries) from combat.
